Maintain a neutral head and neck position. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement as if you were holding an egg under your chin.
2. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine. Your shoulder blades should be slightly down and back, and your upper back should remain tight and stable throughout the entire set.
3. Grab the barbell with a wide grip that is slightly wider than your shoulders.
4. Rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats.
5. Without losing your alignment, lift the barbell off of the uprights. Your wrist should be neutral and in line with your elbows.
6. Slowly lower the barbell towards your lower chest by bending your elbows.
7. Lower the barbell until your upper arms are in line with your back. Your elbows should be at a 45-degree angle.
8. Pause for 1â€“2 seconds at the bottom position
9. For the upward movement, squeeze your chest and begin to straighten your elbows.
10. Squeeze your chest and triceps at the top of the movement while maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
11. Repeat this movement for the desired amount of repetitions."
